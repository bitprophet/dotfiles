# Override fzf key-bindings.zsh default of 'find' (invoked in a way that skips
# _all dotfiles_ which is really frustrating!)
# Specifically, they include a "-path */.*" in the "prune all these mofos" bit
# in the first half, which means "don't descend into any of these". Good for
# not accidentally following symlinks into tmpfs; bad for when you want to look
# into .github/ or open a .env file or etc!
# Adapted from fzf 0.45.0 as packaged by nixos.
