# fzf 0.5X is /somewhat/ smarter about its builtin ctrl-t file 'walker' than
# 0.4X was, but one would still have to configure --walker-skip=xxx,
# duplicating all my ~/.agrc ignore flags. So let's just reuse ag like I did at
# one point in the recent past: list-all-files in cwd, then list-all-dirs too.
