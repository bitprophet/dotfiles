# independent at or above the 'platform' level
export PYENV_ROOT=/usr/local/var/pyenv
# TODO: may need some of the other bits from the mac config like config opts or
# maybe cflags...
# NEW vs homebrew: gotta add pyenv's own bin stubs to path (this is something
# brew prob does for us...)
export PATH=$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH
# Copied again from mac version: add shims to PATH
# TODO: why didn't I ever need `pyenv init` on macOS? Do I need it here? Is it
# literally just the below?
export PATH=/usr/local/var/pyenv/shims:$PATH
