# NO default session configs with 'new-session' anymore!
# This is due to a limitation of tmuxp where it doesn't let you /not/ manage
# sessions with its session_name config key.
# Thus, for now, *always enter tmux via 'mux'* and you'll get a 'main' session
# that way.
# TODO: this is getting increasingly stupid so maybe just use tmuxp as a lib in
# your own callable script sometime...
# Anyway, that stuff is: vvv
# - ~/.zsh/aliases::mux() (or wherever that func is now)
# - tmuxp (typically installed as system package)
# - ~/.tmuxp/* (or wherever the yaml lives now)
