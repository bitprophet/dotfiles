    " soft wrap!

" c: hard-wrap at textwidth for comments, but autoinsert comment character too
" r: also autoinsert comment character when making new lines after existing
"    comment lines
" o: ditto but for o/O in normal mode
" q: Allow 'gq' to autowrap/autoformat comments as well as normal text
" n: Recognize numbered lists when autoformatting (don't explicitly need this,
"    was probably in a default setup somewhere.)
" 2: Use 2nd line of a paragraph for the overall indentation level when
"    autoformatting. Good for e.g. bulleted lists or other formats where first
"    line in a paragraph may have a different indent than the rest.
